## Third party libraries used: 

1. Bootstrap: for help with some basic styling on the app
2. momentjs: for help with date and time conversions

## Code Tasks: 
Most of the application was fairly straight-forward but the Time conversion part of the task was a bit tricky to manage before I decided to use momentjs for it, but once I added momentjs it was simple.

## Time taken to complete the task:
about 6hrs
